;;; Commentary:

;; `diff-hl-show-hunk' shows a popup with the modification hunk at point.
;; `diff-hl-show-hunk-function' points to the backend used to show the hunk.
;; Its default value is `diff-hl-show-hunk-inline', that shows diffs inline
;; using overlay.  There is another built-in backend:
;; `diff-hl-show-hunk-posframe' (based on posframe).
;;
;; `diff-hl-show-hunk-mouse-mode' adds interaction on clicking in the
;; margin or the fringe (shows the current hunk as well).
;;
;; To use it in all buffers:
;;
;;   (global-diff-hl-show-hunk-mouse-mode)
