;;; Commentary:

;; `diff-hl-mode' highlights uncommitted changes on the side of the
;; window (using the fringe, by default), allows you to jump between
;; the hunks and revert them selectively.

;; Provided commands:
;;
;; `diff-hl-diff-goto-hunk'  C-x v =
;; `diff-hl-revert-hunk'     C-x v n
;; `diff-hl-previous-hunk'   C-x v [
;; `diff-hl-next-hunk'       C-x v ]
;; `diff-hl-show-hunk'       C-x v *
;; `diff-hl-stage-current-hunk' C-x v S
;; `diff-hl-set-reference-rev'
;; `diff-hl-reset-reference-rev'
;; `diff-hl-unstage-file'
;;
;; The mode takes advantage of `smartrep' if it is installed.
;;
;; Alternatively, it integrates with `repeat-mode' (Emacs 28+).

;; Add either of the following to your init file.
;;
;; To use it in all buffers:
;;
;; (global-diff-hl-mode)
;;
;; Only in `prog-mode' buffers, with `vc-dir' integration:
;;
;; (add-hook 'prog-mode-hook 'turn-on-diff-hl-mode)
;; (add-hook 'vc-dir-mode-hook 'turn-on-diff-hl-mode)
